/**
 * @file firestore.rules
 * @description Security rules for the RideLog Nepal Firestore database.
 *
 * @section Core Philosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All personal data, such as
 * fuel logs, service records, and trips, is stored in a private data tree
 * accessible only to the authenticated owner.
 *
 * @section Data Structure
 * User data is hierarchically organized under `/users/{userId}`. A separate
 * top-level collection, `/rider_board`, stores publicly readable leaderboard data.
 *
 * @section Key Security Decisions
 * - **Private User Data**: All collections under `/users/{userId}` are strictly
 *   private. A user can only read and write their own documents. Listing of other
 *   users' data is disallowed.
 * - **Public Leaderboard**: The `/rider_board` collection is publicly readable by
 *   any client, allowing the app to display the leaderboard to all users.
 * - **Protected Writes**: Writes to the `/rider_board` are disallowed from the
 *   client. This data should be managed by a trusted backend process (e.g., Cloud
 *   Functions) that aggregates trip data to prevent cheating. This enforces data
 *   integrity for the leaderboard.
 * - **No User Listing**: The top-level `/users` collection is not defined,
 *   effectively preventing any client from listing all users in the application.
 *
 * @section Denormalization for Authorization
 * The security model relies on path-based authorization, where the user's UID is
 * part of the document path (e.g., `/users/{userId}`). This avoids the need for
 * slow and costly `get()` calls in rules to check for ownership.
 *
 * @section Structural Segregation
 * Private user data (logs, trips) is structurally segregated from public data
 * (leaderboard). This prevents accidental data leakage and allows for simple,
 * performant security rules for list operations.
